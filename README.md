# Optimal Soccer Position Suggestion with Machine Learning

### Description
This web application predicts the optimal soccer position (GK, DF, M, or ST) based on user-inputted data and a machine learning algorithm trained with about 90,000 professional footballers data from football manager.  In addition to the optimal position suggestion, the application returns the predicted class probabilities for each of the four outcomes, enabling the user to understand their potential to thrive in more positions than just the suggested one or a more specific position that entails playstyles of several of the four positions, such as wingback and atacking midfielder.  A simple multinomial regression performed best in resampling, and about 97% accuracy was achieved with the testing set.  Python was used throughout the project.

### How to use it
